## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed when system before ship-out:

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:** 

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device , confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is under running state

    systemctl status iotedge
