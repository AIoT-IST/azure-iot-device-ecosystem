# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect BTE device running Windows 10 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   BTE device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Follow the instructions from [device website](http://www.btenetworks.com)

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the sample
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample
-   Please find Azure IoT SDKs for C sample code [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/).

### 3.1.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub:
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2017 and open project from here:

        iothub_client\samples\iothub_ll_telemetry_sample\windows\iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.sln

-   Go to `iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c`, replace the **[device connection string]** placeholder with **connection string** of the device you have created in Provision your device and get its credentials and save the file.
-    An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

     In the sample's main source file, find the line similar to this:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";


     and replace [device connection string] with a valid device connection string for a device registered with your IoT Hub.

-   In Solution Explorer, right-click the **iothub\_ll\_telemetry\_sample** project, click Debug, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

### 3.1.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2017 and open project from here:

-   Open `iothub_client\samples\iothub_ll_c2d_sample\windows\iothub_ll_c2d_sample.sln`

-   Go to **iothub\_ll\_c2d\_sample.c**, replace the `[device connection string]` placeholder with connection string of the device you have created in Provision your device and get its credentials and save the file. An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

-   In the sample's main source file, find the line similar to this:

        <static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

    and replace [device connection string] with a valid device connection string for a device registered with your IoT Hub.

-   In Solution Explorer, right-click the **iothub\_ll\_c2d\_sample** project, click Debug, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. 


## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
