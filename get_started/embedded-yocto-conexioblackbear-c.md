# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to build  Azure IoT SDK for CONEXIOBlackBear. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Sign Up To Azure IoT Hub][sign-iot-hub]
-   Prepare CONEXIOBlackBear
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   USB Storage

# Step 2: Prepare development machine

Follow these steps to prepare the development machine.
See the ConexioBlaxkBear manual for details.

## 2.1 Install Yocto SDK

-   Download Yocto SDK, refer to ConexioBlaxkBear manual.

-   Install Yocto SDK on the development machine (Ubuntu 18.04).

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Install Azure IoT SDK

-   Download Azure IoT Device SDK for C on the development machine:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

## 3.2 Build SDK and sample

-   Add device connect string into below file by using `vi`:

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c
        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_c2d_sample/iothub_ll_c2d_sample.c

-   Find the following place holder for device connection string:

        connectionString = "[device connection string]"

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Run following commands to build the SDK with the generated toolchain:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux
        ./build.sh  --toolchain-file /opt/fsl-imx-fb/{OS version}/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/share/cmake/OEToolchainConfig.cmake -cl --sysroot="/opt/fsl-imx-fb/{OS version}/sysroots/cortexa9hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi"

-   After a successful build, you can copy **azure-iot-sdk-c** folder onto the USB Storage.

-   Insert USB Storage into CONEXIOBlackBear and boot to the Linux prompt.

-   Navigate to samples directory:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples

## 3.3 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample application using the following command:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample
        ./iothub_ll_telemetry_sample

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.4 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   Run the sample application using the following command:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_c2d_sample
        ./iothub_ll_c2d_sample

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
