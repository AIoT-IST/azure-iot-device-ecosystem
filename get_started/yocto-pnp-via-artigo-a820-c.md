# Introduction 

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect VIA ARTiGO A820 to Azure IoT Central application using the IoT plug and Play model. Plug and Play simplifies IoT by allowing solution developers to integrate devices without writing any device code. Using Plug and Play, device manufacturers will provide a model of their device to cloud developers to be integrated quickly into IoT Central or any solution built on the Azure IoT platform. IoT Plug and Play will be open to the community by way of a definition language and SDKs.


The VIA ARTiGO A820 is an ultra-slim fanless enterprise IoT gateway system featuring robust networking connectivity options with dual Ethernet ports as well as optional high-speed wireless networking modules to enable flexible integration with the enterprise network and the cloud.
