# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect RIO IoT Gateway device running Raspbian Lite with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Computer with Git client installed 
-   RIO IoT Gateway device.

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Install the latest Raspbian operating system on your RIO IoT Gateway.
-   After installation, the Raspberry Pi configuration menu is ready. You can set the date/time for your region. Under Advanced Options, enable ssh so you can access the device remotely with Putty.
-   Connect RIO device to your network using an ethernet cable or a wireless
-   You need the configure IP address of RIO device in order to connect over the network.
-   Then, you will be able to see that your device is working, 
-   Open SSH terminal program (Putty)
-   Enter IP address and Port (22) and select Connection Type as SSH 
-   When connection is done, login with username (pi) and password (raspberry)

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Choose your commands in next steps based on the OS running on your device.

-   Run following command to check if NodeJS is already installed

        node --version

    If version is **0.12.x or greater**, then skip next step of installing prerequisite packages. Else uninstall it by issuing following command from command line on the device.{{***Keep the command set based on your OS and remove the rest.***}}

        sudo apt-get remove nodejs

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device.

        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -

        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

    **Note:** To test successful installation of Node JS, try to fetch its version information by running following command:

        node --version

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    PuTTY:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory `~/azure-iot-sdk-node`.

<a name="BuildSamples"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING='<iothub_connection_string>'

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice: 

		cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples
		
-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

		var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";


-   Run the following commands before leaving the ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples directory 

        npm link azure-iot-device

<a name="Run"></a>
## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/send_batch_http.js

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
