# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect unitech TB160 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:



<a name="Setup_DevEnv"></a>
-   [Prepare your development environment][devbox_setup]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   unitech TB160

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device



-  Turn on your unitech TB160 and connect to internet



<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample
Please find Azure IoT SDKs for C sample code [here][c-sample-code].



1.  Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015 and open project from here:

        azure-iot-sdk-c\iothub_client\samples\iothub_client_sample_http\windows\

2.  Go to **iothub_client_sample_http.c**, replace the **[device connection string]** placeholder with connection string of the device you have created in [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub] and save the file.  An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

         HostName=[YourIoTHubName];SharedAccessKeyName=[YourAccessKeyName];SharedAccessKey=[YourAccessKey]

3. See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

4. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **iothub_client_sample_http** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

5. See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
