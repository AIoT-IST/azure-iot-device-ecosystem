# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Grapeboard device running Python with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]


<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Use the [Grapeboard user guide](https://grapeboard.com/) to build and flash the RFS.
-   (Optional) Install nano. This manual is written for use with nano, but the preinstalled text editor VIM can also be used.

        apt-get install nano

# Step 3: Build and Validate the sample using Python libraries

This section walks you through building, deploying and validating the IoT Client SDK on your device running a Linux operating system. You will install necessary prerequisites on your device. Once done, you will build and deploy the IoT Client SDK and validate the sample tests required for IoT certification with the Azure IoT SDK.

<a name="Step-3-1-Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device. Choose your commands based on the OS running on your device.

    **Debian or Ubuntu**

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential cmake git python2.7-dev libboost-python-dev

    ***Note:*** *This setup process requires cmake version 2.8.12 or higher.*

    *You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the  following command:*

        cmake --version

    *This library also requires gcc version 4.9 or higher. You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the following command:*

        gcc --version

    *For information about how to upgrade your version of gcc on Ubuntu 14.04, see <http://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-4-9-on-ubuntu-14-04>.*

    *This library also requires Python version 2.7.x. You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the following command:*

          python --version

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in PuTTY:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the
    directory ~/azure-iot-sdk-python.

<a name="Step-3-2-Build"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   Run following commands to build the SDK:

        cd python/build_all/linux
        sudo ./build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   After a successful build, the `iothub_client.so` Python extension module is copied to the **python/device/samples** folder.


<a name="Step-3-3-Run"></a>
## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

In this section you will run the Azure IoT client SDK samples to validate
communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub. You will send messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages send from the Azure IoT Hub to client.

-   Navigate to samples folder by executing following command:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-python/device/samples/

-   Run the following command on the device:

        nano iothub_client_sample.py

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    connection information.

-   Find the following place holder for device connection string:

        connectionString = "[device connection string]"

-   Replace the above placeholder with your device connection string obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites).

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub and receive messages on your Device:

-   Run the sample application using the following command:

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample.py -p amqp

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample.py -p http

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample.py -p mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and to learn how to sent messages to the Device.
