This folder contains documents that provide "getting started" instructions for using the IoT device SDKs to create IoT device client applications to run on various platforms and operating systems.

Each document describes:

- How to obtain the source code for build a simple client application for the platform that uses one of the IoT device SDKs to facilitate communication with IoT Hub.
- How to configure IoT Hub to receive messages from the sample application.
- How to run the sample application on the device.
- How to verify that the device is communicating with IoT Hub.

For a list of the currently certified devices, see the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog][lnk-compatibilty]
