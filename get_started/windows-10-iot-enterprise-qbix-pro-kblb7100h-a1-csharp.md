# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Create a bootable USB Drive. Please follow this guide on how to create a bootable drive (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool>).
-   Insert the bootable USB Drive from the previous step into your [QBiX-Pro-KBLB7100H-A1](http://www.gigaipc.com/?action=products3&cid=1536866789088331900&tid=1536869180071893800&pid=1540780825001919800). Turn on your [QBiX-Pro-KBLB7100H-A1](http://www.gigaipc.com/?action=products3&cid=1536866789088331900&tid=1536869180071893800&pid=1540780825001919800) device and press the **Delete** key.
-   Change the BIOS Boot option filter to **UEFI and Legacy**.
-   Change the **Boot Option Priorities** to boot from your USB Drive.
-   Save changes and restart your [QBiX-Pro-KBLB7100H-A1](http://www.gigaipc.com/?action=products3&cid=1536866789088331900&tid=1536869180071893800&pid=1540780825001919800). Follow on screen instructions to install Windows Operating System on your [QBiX-Pro-KBLB7100H-A1](http://www.gigaipc.com/?action=products3&cid=1536866789088331900&tid=1536869180071893800&pid=1540780825001919800).
-   Wait until the operating system is ready.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

Sign Up To Azure IoT Hub

Follow the instructions [here](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p) on how to sign up to the Azure IoT Hub service.
As part of the sign up process, you will receive the connection string.

-   **IoT Hub Connection String**: An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

        HostName=[YourIoTHubName];SharedAccessKeyName=[YourAccessKeyName];SharedAccessKey=[YourAccessKey]

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
-   Open the **iothub\_csharp\_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, open the **Program.cs** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";

-   Replace <replace> with the connection string for your device.
-   In visual Studio, under Solution Explorer, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug âˆ’> Start** new instance to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/docs?title=Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/manage_iot_hub) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
