Select the preferred language from the pull down menu in the upper right of the login screen. (Refer to　above.)

The currently selectable languages available are **Japanese** and **English**. Once selected, the language will be displayed on each screen in the Web setup tool.

When the login screen is displayed, go to the upper right of the screen where **Please Select Your Language** is located to select the preferred language. Enter **patlite** in the password field, then click the **Logging In** button.

The default password is set to "patlite." Be sure to change the password to prevent any security breaching.

2.  Setting the IP Address

After logging in, the web setup tool will be executed and the **System Setup** screen will be displayed.

1.  Click the **Setup Menu** in the Setup Table Entry on the left-hand side of the setup screen.

2.  Click **System Setup** from the tree menu. The System Setup Screen is displayed. (Refer to **Figure 2.7.2--2**)

    ![](./media/PATLITE_NH-FV/image3.PNG)

    In the System Setup Screen, the network can be changed.

    **Setup Method:**

3.  Enter the Main Unit IP address.

4.  Set up the net mask, default gateway, etc. if needed.

5.  Click the **Set** button to activate the setup.

**Setup Confirmation:**

If the web browser address is reflecting the changed value of the IP address after clicking **To the Login screen**, the setup of the new IP address has been  uccessful. However, in cases where the preset value of other networks had been changed, be sure to enter the proper IP Address value where it was moved to in order to verify it in the system setup screen.

Verify that the IP Address has changed (Below example shows
**192.168.10.1**)

## 3.3 Clock Setup

The PC clock time is reflected in this product when logged in again.

**[Setup Method]**

1.  Compare the columns between the **NH Monitor Time** and the **Host Computer Time**.

2.  Click the **Manually Setup Clock** button to synchronize the time with the PC which is logged in.
