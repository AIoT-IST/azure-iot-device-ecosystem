# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to run runtime samples to manage Supermicro SYS-E300-9D-8CN8TP Azure IoT edge server, with Azure IoT edge Runtime preinstalled in Ubuntu 18.04. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and Deploy client component to test device management capability

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

## 2.1 Introduce System 

-   SYS-E300-9D-8CN8TP is a compact, embedded system comprised of the SCE300 chassis and the X11SDV-4C-TP8F/8C-TP8F single processor motherboard. 
-   Complete server supports up to 512GB of DDR4-2666/2400/2133 ECC LRDIMM or up to 256GB of DDR4-2666/2400/2133 ECC/non-ECC RDIMM memory in four DIMM slots and Single fixed 2.5" hard drive bay with bracket (when AOC area is not occupied).

## 2.2 System Setup Instruction

-   In shipping box, there is a 150W Power adapter. Please connect power cable and lock power adapter to chassis.

## Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed when system before ship-out:

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:** 

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge server, confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is under running state

    systemctl status iotedge

 ![](./media/sys-e300-9d-8cn8tp/3.png)

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge server, confirm that the module deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge server. You will only see edgeAgent module running out of box.

    sudo iotedge list

 ![](./media/sys-e300-9d-8cn8tp/4.png)

On the device details page of the Azure, you should see the runtime modules - edgeAgent under running status
