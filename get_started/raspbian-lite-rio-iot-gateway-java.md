# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect RIO IoT Gateway device running Raspbian Lite with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   RIO IoT Gateway device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Install the latest Raspbian operating system on your RIO IoT Gateway.
-   After installation, the Raspberry Pi configuration menu is ready. You can set the date/time for your region. Under Advanced Options, enable ssh so you can access the device remotely with Putty.
-   Connect RIO device to your network using an ethernet cable or a wireless
-   You need the configure IP address of RIO device in order to connect over the network.
-   Then, you will be able to see that your device is working, 
-   Open SSH terminal program (Putty)
-   Enter IP address and Port (22) and select Connection Type as SSH 
-   When connection is done, login with username (pi) and password (raspberry)

# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample
If you have successfully prepared your development environment the IoT device SDK and all samples should be built and ready to use.

-   Start a new instance of the Device Explorer, select or create a new device, obtain and note the connection string for the device, and begin monitoring under the Data tab.
-   Build the client library alonf with the samples.

		{IoT device SDK root}/java/device/>mvn install -DskipTests
		
    On build completion, you will see summary of what got built. 
   
-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for the sample that you wish to run and run the samples as follows:

    For example, the executable JAR file for sending and receving event, send-receive-sample can be found at:

        {IoT device SDK root}/java/device/samples/send-receive-sample/target/send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar
    
	Navigate to the directory with the sample. Run the sample using the following command:        

        java -jar ./send-receive-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "{https or amqps or mqtt or amqps_ws }"
