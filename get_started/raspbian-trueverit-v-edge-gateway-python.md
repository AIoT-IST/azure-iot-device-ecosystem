# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Trueverit V Edge Gateway device running Raspbian 10 Buster with Azure IoT Edge Runtime pre-installed and Device Management. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and Deploy client component to test device management capability

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Sign up to IOT Hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Add the Edge Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux)
-   [Add the Edge Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux#deploy-a-module)
-   Trueverit V Edge Gateway device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   As an Enterprise grade Plug & Play device, you can flash the specified base Operating System (Raspbian 10 Buster) version into a microSD using the win32flashtools or Balena Etcher
-   Put the sd into the housing screwing down the screw placed in the lower right part of the gateway
-   Connect a power source to the Edge Gateway, like: 110-230VAC, 12VDC or PoE Lan Cable
-   A led green will show you the correct power presence, at this point, the Trueverit V Edge Gateway will start it's booting process
-   To get the ip address of the device, you have three options:
    -   Ping the address: ping trueverit-edge.local and get the respective IP address
    -  Do a network scan and identify the corresponding Trueverit-Edge device
    -   Access the console device using a USB-COM RJ-45 cable and login with the default credentials

## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:** 

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device , confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is under running state

    systemctl status iotedge

 ![](./media/trueverit/1.png)

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device, confirm that the module deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge device

    sudo iotedge list

 ![](./media/trueverit/2.png) 

On the device details page of the Azure, you should see the runtime modules - edgeAgent, edgeHub and tempSensor modueles are under running status
