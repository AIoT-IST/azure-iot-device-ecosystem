## 2.4 Configure SSH Access of Rooster NSX7000 device

-   Configure [SSH Access](https://192.168.62.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/admin) in order to copy samples to your Rooster NSX7000 device from your development environment and in order to run them.

-    Run the following commands on your development environment to generate authentication key.

      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

-   Open the [Administration page](https://192.168.62.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/admin) to configure SSH Access.
    -   Scroll down the page and show "Dropbear Instance" section.
    -   Cofigure the following settings.
    -   Enable ssh server: `On`(checked)
    -   Interface: Select `eth0`
    -   Password authentication: `Off`(unchecked)
    -   Allow root logins with password: `Off`(unchecked)
 
       ![Dropbear Instance](./media/nsx7000/01_ssh_dropbear.png)

    -   Scroll down the page and show "SSH-Keys" section.
    -   Select "[suncorp]" tab, then paste your public key generated on your development environment. Don't forget to click "[SAVE & APPLY]".
  
      ![SSH-Key](./media/nsx7000/02_ssh_key.png "suncorp ssh-key")

## 2.5 Confirm Java package is installed

-   Make sure Java package(oracle-java-compact2) is installed on your Rooster NSX7000 device.

-   Open the [Package Management page](https://192.168.62.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/package).
    -   Scroll down the page and show "Package List" section.
    -   Confirm "oracle-java-compact2" package is shown in the Package List.

# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample

## 3.1 Build the Azure IoT Device SDK for Java
Run the following commands on your development environment in sequence to build Azure IoT SDK [after you have prepared your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/get_started/java-devbox-setup.md) in Step 1.

    cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iot-device-samples
    mvn install -DskipTests | tee JavaSDK_Build_skipTests_Logs.txt

## 3.2 Copy the Samples to Rooster NSX7000 device
Run the following commands on your development environment in order to copy the samples to your Rooster NSX7000 device.

    cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iot-device-samples/send-event/target
    scp send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar suncorp@192.168.62.1:/home/suncorp
    cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iot-device-samples/handle-messages/target
    scp handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar suncorp@192.168.62.1:/home/suncorp

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Connect the Device

-   Connect your Rooster NSX7000 device with TeraTerm using ssh.

### 3.3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub

-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for send event sample
and set `java_runtime` variable.

      cd $HOME
      java_runtime=/app/package/java-runtime/bin/java

-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**
  
        ${java_runtime} -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "amqps"

    **If using HTTPS protocol:**
    
       ${java_runtime} -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        ${java_runtime} -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "mqtt"

    **If using Web Sockets with AMQPS protocol:**
    
        ${java_runtime} -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "amqps_ws"

  Replace the following in above command:  
  `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build  
  `{connection string}`: Your device connection string  
  `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub  

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.2.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub
-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for the receive message sample
and set `java_runtime` variable.

      cd $HOME
      java_runtime=/app/package/java-runtime/bin/java

-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**
  
        ${java_runtime} -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "amqps"

    **If using HTTPS protocol:**

        ${java_runtime} -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        ${java_runtime} -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "mqtt"

    **If using Web Sockets with AMQPS protocol:**

        ${java_runtime} -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "amqps_ws"

      Replace the following in above command:  
     `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build  
     `{connection string}`: Your device connection string  
     `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
