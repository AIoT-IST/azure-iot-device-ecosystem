# Introduction 

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect VIA AMOS-820 to Azure IoT Central application using the IoT plug and Play model. Plug and Play simplifies IoT by allowing solution developers to integrate devices without writing any device code. Using Plug and Play, device manufacturers will provide a model of their device to cloud developers to be integrated quickly into IoT Central or any solution built on the Azure IoT platform. IoT Plug and Play will be open to the community by way of a definition language and SDKs.

Fast-track your IoT and edge intelligence deployments with the VIA AMOS-820. Combining the advanced compute and graphics performance of NXP i.MX 6Quad series processors with a wealth of I/O and connectivity features, this ultra-compact fanless system provides a highly-customizable low-power solution for a host of industrial IoT, enterprise IoT, smart transportation, and energy management applications.

With its ruggedized design and wide operating temperature range, the VIA AMOS-820 provides an ultra-reliable solution for mission-critical edge installations in the most demanding indoor and outdoor environments â€“ from busy factory and warehouse floors to remote wind and solar farms.

# Integration with IoT Central

Azure IoT Central Setup

-   Create an **Azure IoT Central accout** and launch the **public preview** application.
-   Click ***Administaration -> Device Connection -> Certificates (X.509)***.
-   Upload and verify your certificate.
-   Generate a device **certificate**, **private key** and remember your **Common Name** and **Scope Id**.
-   Click **Device templates -> + New**. Choose pre-certified device **"VIA AMOS-820"**.

**VIA AMOS-820 Setup**

-   Copy your device **certificate** and **private key** to ***VIA-AMOS820-PnP-Package/Certificate*** folder and rename as **device-ca.pem** and **device-key.pem**, respectively. 
-   Modify the device-name and scope-id in ***VIA-AMOS820-PnP-Package/pnp.conf*** to yours. The device-name is your certificate **Common Name** and scope-id is your **Azure IoT Central Scope Id**.
-   Change directory to VIA-AMOS820-PnP-Package and start the program by the command: 

    ```bash
    $ ./start.sh
    ```
**Check Azure IoT Central**

-   Clicks ***Devices***, and you can see that your VIA AMOS-820 register to IoT Central.
-   Click your VIA AMOS-820. You can see the messages from VIA AMOS-820
