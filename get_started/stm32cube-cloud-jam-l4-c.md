# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect RushUp [Cloud-JAM L4](http://rushup.tech/) board to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, by leveraging on Azure IoT Device SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering STM32 Cloud-JAM L4 to Azure IoT Hub
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on Cloud-JAM L4

Cloud-JAM L4 is the product accelerator (production grade solution) of ST's functional pack P-NUCLEO-AZURE1 that combines:

-   NUCLEO L476RG
-   NUCLEO SHIELD IKS01A2
-   NUCLEO SHIELD NFC01A1
-   NUCLEO SHIELD IDW01M1

At a firmware level the Cloud-Jam L4 works the same way as those 4 hardware combined.

So any project or binary created for STM32L476RG microcontroller can be run or debugged on the Cloud- JAM L4.

![Build\_Project](media/cloud-jam-l4/build-project.png)

### Flash the binary

Flash the binary to Cloud-JAM L4 board. The sample application you have compiled include a procedure to implement Over-The-Air (OTA) Firmware upadate, which can be combined with [Azure IoT Hub primitives for device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview) (see following sections). Firmware update procedure requires a bootloader to be installed together with the Firmware binary; in order to properly flash both, scripts are provided for each IDE used. In [SystemWorkbench for STM32](http://www.openstm32.org/System+Workbench+for+STM32) scripts for Windows/OSx/Linux can be found in `Projects/STM32L476RG-Nucleo/Application/Azure_Sns_DM/SW4STM32/STM32L476RG-Nucleo`. In Windows simply click on `CleanAzure1mbedTLS.bat`

![Flash\_Memory](media/cloud-jam-l4/flash-memory.png)

For OSx/Linux, scripts require configuration according to your setup; edit `OpenOCD_DIR` and `OpenOCD_CFC` variables as shown in the following picture, following the installation path of openocd binaries (`tools/openocd/`) and scripts (`openocd/scripts`).

![Flash\_Memory\_OSxLinux](media/cloud-jam-l4/flash-memory-osx-linux.png)

### Configure your serial terminal and start the application

Configure your serial terminal as shown in the following picture for TeraTerm (baudrate set to 115200):

![Configure\_Terminal](media/cloud-jam-l4/configure-terminal.png)

Reset the kit by pressing the RESET button on Cloud-JAM L4 board to start the application.

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub

After RESET, the application join the Wi-Fi access point and connect to your Azure IoT Hub. When connection is established, the application transmits periodically messages containing inertial and environmental data read from the board.

USER LED onboard blinks once connection with Azure IoT Hub is established. Application can be stopped by pressing USER button.

Messages successfully transmitted to your Azure IoT Hub are printed over your serial terminal interface.

![Send](media/cloud-jam-l4/send-01.png)

To visualize messages received in IoT Hub with iothub-explorer, open Node.js command prompt and insert the following commands:

    iothub-explorer login <iot-hub-connection-string>
    iothub-explorer monitor-events <device name> --login <iot-hub-connection-string>

![Send](media/cloud-jam-l4/send-02.png)

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

To send a message from IoT Hub to [Cloud-JAM L4](http://rushup.tech/) board with iothub-explorer, open the command prompt and insert the following commands:

    Iothub-explorer send <DEVICE_NAME> {"""Name""":"""<Message>""","""Parameters""":{}}  --ack=full

Messages received by STM32 Cloud-JAM L4 are printed over serial terminal interface once received. Some cloud-to-device messages are also interpreted by the application:

-   Pause : pause the application
-   Play : restart the application after a pause
-   LedOn/LedOff : turn on/off LED2 onboard Nucleo
-   LedBlink : LED2 onboard Nucleo will blink for each message transmitted

To see those events from another terminal you can run:

    Iothub-explorer monitor-feedback <DEVICE_NAME>
