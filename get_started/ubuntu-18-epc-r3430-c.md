# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Sign up to IOT Hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Add the Edge Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart)
-   [Add the Edge Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart#deploy-a-module)

# Step 3: Manual Test for Azure IoT Edge on device

This section walks you through the test to be performed on the Edge devices running the Linux operating system such that it can qualify for Azure IoT Edge certification.

## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:**

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device , confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is
under running state

    systemctl status iotedge

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device, confirm that the module deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge device

    sudo iotedge list

![](./media/EPC-R3430/listedge.png)

On the device details page of the Azure, you should see the runtime modules - edgeAgent, edgeHub and tempSensor modueles are under running status
