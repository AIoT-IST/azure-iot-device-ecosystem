# Connect Whiznano Gateway to Azure IoT Hub in the cloud

## What you do

Connect Whiznano Gateway to an IoT hub that you create. 


## What you learn

-   How to create an IoT Hub
-   How to prepare Whiznano Gateway 

## What you need

To complete this operation, you need the following parts:

![Whiznano Gateway](./media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/whiznano.png)

-   [Whiznano Gateway](https://www.whizpace.com/products-and-services)
-   [TeraTerm Serial Utility](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/downloads/72009/teraterm-4.105.exe/)
-   Internet Connection

## Create an IoT hub

### To create your IoT hub in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.  Click **New** > **Internet of Things** > **IoT Hub**.

    ![Create IoT hub](media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/3_iot-hub-creation.png)

3.  In the **IoT hub** pane, enter the necessary information for your IoT hub:

    ![Basic information for IoT hub creation](media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/4_iot-hub-provide-basic-info.png)

   -   **Name**: The name for your IoT hub. If the name you enter is valid, a green check mark appears.
   -   **Pricing and scale tier**: Select the free F1 tier for this demo. See [pricing and scale tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/).
   -   **Resource group**: Create a resource group to host the IoT hub, or use an existing one. See [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md).
   -   **Location**: Select the closest location to you where the IoT hub is created.
   -   **Pin to dashboard**: Select this option for easy access to your IoT hub from the dashboard.

4.  Click **Create**. It could take a few minutes for your IoT hub to be created. You can see progress in the **Notifications** pane.

    ![Monitor the IoT hub creation progress in the notification pane](media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/5_iot-hub-monitor-creation-progress-notification-pane.png)

5.  After your IoT hub is created, click it from the dashboard. Make a note of the **Hostname** value that is used later in this article, and then click **Shared access policies**.

    ![Get the Hostname of your IoT hub](media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/6_iot-hub-get-hostname.png)

6.  In the **Shared access policies** pane, click the **iothubowner** policy, and then copy and save the **Connection string** value for your IoT hub. You use this value later in this article. For more information, see [Control access to IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-security.md).

    ![Get IoT hub connection string](media/Whiznano_Gateway_Hub/7_iot-hub-get-connection-string.png)

You've now created your IoT hub. Ensure that you save the **Hostname** and **Connection string** values. They're used later in this article.

# Prepare the device

Set up your PC first. Ensure IP Address: 192.168.1.10, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
-   Go to Control Panel
-   Network and Internet -> View network status and tasks
-   Left Hand Side of Screen. Click on “Change network setting”
-   Right Click on Ethernet -> Properties
-   Under Networking, Select Internet Protocol (IPv4) -> Click on Properties
-   Select Use the following IP Address: <br/>
