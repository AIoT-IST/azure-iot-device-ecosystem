# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect MF0200 IoT Intelligent Connected Gateway device running Mentor Embedded Linux with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   MF0200 IoT Intelligent Connected Gateway device.
-   A computer with Mentor Embedded Linux for MF0200 IoT Intelligent Connected Gateway installed. 
-   Terminal Emulator software.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   On the host machine with MEL for MF0200 installed, create a build directory using the MEL setup-environment script and include the azure layer:

        <mel-dir>/meta-mentor/setup-environment -l azure mx6q-csp

-   Find the **AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING** variable in ***&lt;build&gt;/local.conf*** file and replace the placeholder with device connection string.

        AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING = “<HostName=...>”

-   Follow MEL instructions to build the image (core-image-sato) and prepare the SD card.

-   Proceed with booting the target and the demo applications will be present on the target root file system at the following location:

        /home/root/azure-iot-sdk-c/

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **If using AMQP protocol:**

        /home/root/azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client_sample_http

    **If using HTTP protocol:**

        /home/root/azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        /home/root/azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
