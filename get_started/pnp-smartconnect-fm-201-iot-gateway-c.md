# Implement Azure IoT PnP on SmartConnect FM-201 IoT Gateway based on Azure IoT C public preview SDK.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the G1 gateway to send data to Azure IoT Central with Azure IoT plug and play.

## Features implemented

-   Azure IoT Plug and Play.
-   Register device by IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service base on SAS Key.
-   Telemetry data sent for Beacon Count/Location.
-   All parameters of the Service tab can be configured as Properties.
-   Cloud to device command(Support upgrading firmware, reboot the gateway,etc).

## What you need

-   SmartConnect FM-201 IoT Gateway
-   An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can register via one of these two methods:
    -   Activate a [free 30-day trial Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
    -   Claim your [Azure credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) if you are MSDN or Visual Studio subscriber.

## Create Azure IoT Central application

1.  Use your Azure account log into [Azure IoT Central](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com).
2.  Create a **free preview application**.

## View the device in Portal of Azure IoT Central

  1.  In your IoT Central application, go to the **Devices** page and select the device you configured in previous step. The device will be automatically registered when the device boots up.

      ![View device, overview](./media/smartconnect-fm-201-iot-gateway/overview-portal.png)

    After a couple of minutes, this page will show the telemetry data.

  2.  Select the **About** page to see the property values the device sent. Refer  to [Properties](#Properties).
  3.  Select the **Commands** page to call commands on the device. Refer to [commands](#Commands).

### Commands

#### Firmware Upgrade

This command is used to  upgrade the gateway’s firmware to the specified version.

There are two ways to upgrade: ***public*** type (the upgrade firmware downloaded from our company's HTTP server,which is equivalent to the *OTA Upgrade* on the Web configuration page), and ***self*** type (the upgrade firmware downloaded from the custom HTTP server, which is equivalent to the *LAN Upgrade* on the Web configuration page).

The message data field is described in detail as follows:

| Field    | Name                                  | Required                                 | Value                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| type     | Upgrade type                          | NO                                       | Optional value: ***public***,***self***<br/>Default value is ***public*** |
| isSave   | Whether to save the configuration     | NO                                       | Optional value: YES,NO<br/>Default value is NO               |
| version  | Target firmware version               | NO(Required if the type is ***public***) | Upgrade to the specified version.                            |
| urlpath  | URL path of HFS                       | NO(Required if the type is ***self***)   | the URL path of the HTTP server where the firmware is located at . The gateway will download the firmware from {urlpath}/{filename}. |
| filename | Firmware file name in URL Path of HFS | NO(Required if the type is ***self***)   | The gateway will download the firmware from {urlpath}/{filename}. |
