# Connect Raspberry Pi to Azure IoT Hub in the cloud

In this tutorial, you begin by learning the basics of working with Raspberry Pi that's running Raspbian. You then learn how to seamlessly connect your devices to the cloud by using [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-what-is-iot-hub). For Windows 10 IoT Core samples, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://www.windowsondevices.com/).

## What you do

* Setup Raspberry Pi.
* Create an IoT hub.
* Register a device for Pi in your IoT hub.
* Run a sample application on Pi to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

Connect Raspberry Pi to an IoT hub that you create. Then you run a sample application on Pi to collect temperature and humidity data from a BME280 sensor. Finally, you send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you learn

* How to create an Azure IoT hub and get your new device connection string.
* How to connect Pi with a BME280 sensor.
* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on Pi.
* How to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you need

![What you need](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/0_starter_kit.jpg)

## Setup Raspberry Pi

### Install the Raspbian operating system for Pi

Prepare the microSD card for installation of the Raspbian image.

1. Download Raspbian.
   -  [Download Raspbian Jessie with Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (the .zip file).
   -  Extract the Raspbian image to a folder on your computer.
2. Install Raspbian to the microSD card.
   -  [Download and install the Etcher SD card burner utility](https://etcher.io/).
   -  Run Etcher and select the Raspbian image that you extracted in step 1.
   -  Select the microSD card drive. Note that Etcher may have already selected the correct drive.
   -  Click Flash to install Raspbian to the microSD card.
   -  Remove the microSD card from your computer when installation is complete. It's safe to remove the microSD card directly because Etcher automatically ejects or unmounts the microSD card upon completion.
   -  Insert the microSD card into Pi.

### Enable SSH and I2C

1. Connect Pi to the monitor, keyboard and mouse, start Pi and then log in Raspbian by using `pi` as the user name and `raspberry` as the password.
2. Click the Raspberry icon > **Preferences** > **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.

   ![The Raspbian Preferences menu](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/1_raspbian-preferences-menu.png)

3. On the **Interfaces** tab, set **I2C** and **SSH** to **Enable**, and then click **OK**.

   ![Enable I2C and SSH on Raspberry Pi](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/2_enable-i2c-ssh-on-raspberry-pi.png)

> **NOTE:** 
To enable SSH and I2C, you can find more reference documents on [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) and [Adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2).

### Connect the sensor to Pi

Use the breadboard and jumper wires to connect an LED and a BME280 to Pi as follows. If you donâ€™t have the sensor, skip this section.

![The Raspberry Pi and sensor connection](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/3_raspberry-pi-sensor-connection.png)


For sensor pins, use the following wiring:

| Start (Sensor & LED)     | End (Board)            | Cable Color   |
| -----------------------  | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| VDD (Pin 5G)             | 3.3V PWR (Pin 1)       | White cable   |
| GND (Pin 7G)             | GND (Pin 6)            | Brown cable   |
| SCK (Pin 8G)             | I2C1 SDA (Pin 3)       | Orange cable  |
| SDI (Pin 10G)            | I2C1 SCL (Pin 5)       | Red cable     |
| LED VDD (Pin 18F)        | GPIO 24 (Pin 18)       | White cable   |
| LED GND (Pin 17F)        | GND (Pin 20)           | Black cable   |

Click to view [Raspberry Pi 2 & 3 Pin mappings](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/iot/docs/pinmappingsrpi) for your reference.

After you've successfully connected BME280 to your Raspberry Pi, it should be like below image.

![Connected Pi and BME280](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/4_connected-pi.jpg)

### Connect Pi to the network

Turn on Pi by using the micro USB cable and the power supply. Use the Ethernet cable to connect Pi to your wired network or follow the [instructions from the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/wifi/) to connect Pi to your wireless network. After your Pi has been successfully connected to the network, you need to take a note of the [IP address of your Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/finding-your-pis-ip-address).

![Connected to wired network](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/5_power-on-pi.jpg)


## Run a sample application on Pi

### Clone sample application and install the prerequisite packages

1. Use one of the following SSH clients from your host computer to connect to your Raspberry Pi.
    - [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) for Windows.
    - The built-in SSH client on Ubuntu or macOS.

2. Clone the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-node-raspberrypi-client-app
   ```

3. Install all packages by the following command. It includes Azure IoT device SDK, BME280 Sensor library and Wiring Pi library.

   ```bash
   cd iot-hub-node-raspberry-pi-clientapp
   npm install
   ```
   > **NOTE:** 
   It might take several minutes to finish this installation process denpening on your network connection.

### Configure the sample application

1. Open the config file by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   nano config.json
   ```

   ![Config file](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/6_config-file.png)

   There are two items in this file you can configurate. The first one is `interval`, which defines the time interval between two messages that send to cloud. The second one `simulatedData`,which is a Boolean value for whether to use simulated sensor data or not.

   If you **don't have the sensor**, set the `simulatedData` value to `true` to make the sample application create and use simulated sensor data.

2. Save and exit by pressing Control-O > Enter > Control-X.

### Run the sample application

1. Run the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo node index.js '<your Azure IoT hub device connection string>'
   ```

   > **NOTE:** 
   Make sure you copy-paste the device connection string into the single quotes.


You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.
