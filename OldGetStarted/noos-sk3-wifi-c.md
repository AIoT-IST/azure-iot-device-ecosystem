# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect SK3 WIFI with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

- Window7 environment
- Oracle VM Ubuntu environment
- [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
- [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
- SK3 WIFI device for running the demo.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

- Get Build Environment ready
 -	Follow this [guide](https://espressif.com/en/support/explore/get-started/esp8266/getting-started-guide)
 -	Under section 3.3. ESP8266 Toolkit, download VirtualBox and the lubuntu image.
 -	Make sure to share a local folder with the VM


-  Get [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) on your host machine
-  git clone https://github.com/meijjun/SK3_WIFI.git
 - For SK3 Develop and Compile environment
Refer http://www.bbfar.com/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1202&extra=page%3D1
 - Learn SK3 Kit tutorials to learn how to use SK3 devices
http://www.bbfar.com/bbs/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=187&page=1


-  Connect the device to internet.
 - On host PC, run adb shell and execute following commands:
 -    ./adb devices
 - 	./adb shell
 -  	Turn on Wifi and configure to connect to internet (commands to configure wifi to connect to internet automatically...)

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample
## 3.1 Modify and Build the Samples

1.	Update the following files within this solution:
    - /examples/project_template/user/user_main.c
Update these values with your own wifi ssid and password for ESP8266 to connect to
uint8 ssid[] =
uint8 password[] =
   - /examples/project_template/gen_misc4.sh
   Update these variables to the path of the shared folder on the VM
export SDK_PATH=~/ESP8266-Azure-IOT
export BIN_PATH=~/ESP8266-Azure-IOT/bin
   - /examples/project_template/user/iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c
   Update the connectionString variable to the device-specific connection string you got earlier from the Setup Azure IoT step:
static const char* connectionString = '[azure connection string]'
The azure connection string contains Hostname, DeviceId, and SharedAccessKey in the format:
"HostName=&lt;host_name&gt;;DeviceId=&lt;device_id&gt;;SharedAccessKey=&lt;device_key&gt;"


2. complie
  Now you are ready to compile From the VM, run the following command from a terminal:
./gen_misc4.sh
Once compliation is completed successfully, you should see something that looks like the following:


## 3.2 Run and Validate the Samples
  In this section you will run the Azure IoT client SDK samples to validate communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub. You will send messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages sent from the Azure IoT Hub to client.
### 3.2.1 Use FLASH_DOWNLOAD_TOOLS tools to upgrade WIFI firmware:
 - Download [wifi.hex](https://github.com/meijjun/SK3_WIFI/blob/master/wifi.hex) into SK3.
 - upgrade WIFI firmware

### 3.2.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:
- 	See [Manage IoT Hub]([lnk-manage-iot-hub]) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.
- 	Power on SK3 WIFI device, will connect IOT Hub automatically, and send data to IOT Hub. In serial log will display corresponding information
- 	check the message is right.  If not, then you may have incorrectly copied the device hub connection information.

### 3.2.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub
- 	See [Manage IoT Hub]([lnk-manage-iot-hub]) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.
- 	In SK3 WIFI log, you can see the received data
