# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect MH-5100 device running Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   MH-5100 device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

### Install Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB on MH-5100

-   Create a bootable USB Drive. Please follow this guide on how to create a bootable drive (<https://www.microsoft.com/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool>).
-   Insert the bootable USB Drive from the previous step into your MH-5100. Turn on your MH-5100 device and press the **Delete** key.
-   Change the BIOS Boot option filter to **"Boot"**.
-   Change the **"Boot Option Priorities"** to boot from your USB Drive.
-   Save changes and restart your MH-5100. Follow on screen instructions to install Windows Operating System on your MH-5100.
-   When Windows 10 install completed, remember change to developer mode.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub\_csharp\_client.sln** solution in the `device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientMqttSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.

    > **DeviceConnectionString** comes from Step 1 (Provision your device and get its credentials).

    > String format is “HostName=xxxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=xxxxx;SharedAccessKey=0xxxxxxxxxxx0xxxxxx0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx”.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client AMQP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
