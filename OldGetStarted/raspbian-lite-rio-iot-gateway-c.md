# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect RIO IoT Gateway device running Raspbian Lite with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Linux System for cross-compiling Azure IOT SDK
-   You can remotely access the command line on the Raspberry Pi via SH client (ex: Putty).
-   Required hardware:
    -   RIO IoT Gateway
    -   16GB MicroSD Card
    -   USB keyboard
    -   USB mouse (optional)
    -   HDMI cable
    -   Monitor that supports HDMI
    -   Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle
-   Setup your IoT hub
-   Provision your device and get its credentials

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Install the latest Raspbian operating system on your RIO IoT Gateway.
-   After installation, the Raspberry Pi configuration menu is ready. You can set the date/time for your region. Under Advanced Options, enable ssh so you can access the device remotely with Putty.
-   Connect RIO device to your network using an ethernet cable or a wireless
-   You need the configure IP address of RIO device in order to connect over the network.
-   Then, you will be able to see that your device is working, 
-   Open SSH terminal program (Putty)
-   Enter IP address and Port (22) and select Connection Type as SSH 
-   When connection is done, login with username (pi) and password (raspberry)

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample
Prepare the cross-compile host according to the instructions, but make sure you modify the connection string before the "Building the SDK" step.

-   Edit the file `~/Source/azure-iot-sdk-c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c` and replace connection string placeholder with the device connection string you obtained when you provisioned your device.The device connection string should be in this format **HostName=<iothub-name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<device-name>;SharedAccessKey=<device-key>**.
(You can use the console-based text editor nano to edit the file):

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
	
	**Note:** You can skip this step if you only want to build the samples without running them.
	
-   Now, follow the instructions in the "Building the SDK" step of the instructions to build the SDK and samples.

-   Finally, create a tar containing the compiled SDK and samples.

        cd ~/Source/ ; tar czvf iotsdk_linux.tar.gz azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux ; scp iotsdk_linux.tar.gz pi@<YOUR-RASPBIAN-HOST>:

-   change YOUR-RASPBIAN-HOST to the hostname of your RIO IoT Gateway
