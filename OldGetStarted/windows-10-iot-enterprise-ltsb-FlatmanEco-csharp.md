# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Flatman ECO device running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2016 LTSB with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Flatman ECO device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

### Windows 10 Iot Enterprise 2016  is installed

-   Connect the power adapter, optinal USB Keyboard/Mouse with Flatman ECO device.
-   Wait until the operating system is ready and connected to the Internet


or

### Install Windows 10 Iot Enterprise 2016 on Flatman Eco

-	Have an look to  [S&T](http://www.snt-embedded.de/produkte/panel-pc/ECO/ECO.en.php) Flatman Eco
-	Install Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB
-	Install I/O Driver
-	Verify I/O functions, especially the network 



In this section, you will register your device using DeviceExplorer. The DeviceExplorer is a Windows application that interfaces with Azure IoT Hub and can perform the following operations:

-   Device management
    -   Create new devices
    -   List existing devices and expose device properties stored on Device Hub
    -   Provides ability to update device keys
    -   Provides ability to delete a device
-   Monitoring events from your device
-   Sending messages to your device

To run DeviceExplorer tool, use your IoT Hub connection string generated from the Azure web portal

-   IoT Hub Connection String

**Steps:**

1.  Click [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/readme.md) to download and install DeviceExplorer.

2.  Add connection information under the **Configuration** tab and click the **Update** button.

3.  Create and register the device with your IoT Hub using instructions as below.

    a. Click the **Management** tab.    
    
    b. Your registered devices will be visible in the list. In case your device is not there in the list, click **Refresh** button. If this is your first time, then you shouldn't retrieve anything.
       
    c. Click **Create** button to create a device ID and key. 
    
    d. Once created successfully, device will be listed in DeviceExplorer. 
    
    e. Right click the device and from context menu select "**Copy connection string for selected device**".
    
    f. Save this information in Notepad. You will need this information in later steps.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
    -   For **AMQP protocol**:

               Navigate to **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project and open the **Program.cs** file.
    -   For **HTTP protocol**:

                Navigate to **DeviceClientHttpSample** project and open the **Program.cs** file.
     -   For **MQTT protocol**:

                Navigate to **DeviceClientMqttSample** project and open the **Program.cs** file.



-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.

    > **DeviceConnectionString** comes from Step 1 (Provision your device and get its credentials).

    > String format is “HostName=xxxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=xxxxx;SharedAccessKey=0xxxxxxxxxxx0xxxxxx0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=”.

-   In **Solution Explorer**,

    -   For **AMQP protocol**:

        Right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

    -   For **HTTP protocol**:

        Right-click the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

    -   For **MQTT protocol**:

        Right-click the **DeviceClientMqttSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client AMQP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
